## 🚀 Overview

The Quantum Control Board is a secure, instantaneous override and remote piloting system for aircraft, satellites, drones, and spacecraft. It leverages the principles behind the Quantum Cursor — a speculative interface built upon quantum entanglement — to create a real-time, hack-resistant communication and control platform.

In crisis scenarios such as crew incapacitation, hijacking, or onboard system failure, this control board can reroute navigation or assume full command of a vehicle without relying on classical signals vulnerable to interference or delay.

## 🧠 Core Features

- Quantum entanglement-based interface (via Quantum Cursor)  
- Instantaneous signal relay — no reliance on radio, GPS, or satellite uplink  
- Magnetic or gesture-based pilot interface (touchless backup controls)  
- Remote operation from ground, secure facility, or orbiting quantum station  

---

## ✨ Use Cases

- Emergency override when pilots are incapacitated  
- Hijack-proof failover system for civilian and military aircraft  
- Quantum-grounded control of satellites or orbiters  
- Real-time operation of space drones or planetary probes  

---

## 🔬 Technical Context

- Based on Bell’s Theorem and quantum entanglement theory  
- Immune to jamming, spoofing, or cyber intrusion  
- May complement future quantum mesh satellite networks
